# QuickStart 

SocketDL is a generic infrastructure that allows developers to connect smart contracts across chains together. 


SocketDL delivers secure cross-chain communication for Web3. Cross-chain communication means you can build a complete experience for your users that lets them interact with any asset, any application, on any chain with one click. Build new usecases that were previously impossible. 

The protocol is entering the alpha stage, you might run into issues here and there but Socket is providing 1:1 support via this group chat on Telegram [here](https://t.me/+rJQCn6T1a-AzZTVl). Please feel free to share bugs, suggestions, feedback
