In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create, deploy, and interact with a cross-chain counter using SocketDL.

### Development Environment

:::info Choosing a Development Environment
Foundry is recommended for those comfortable with command-line tools, while Remix provides a user-friendly interface for beginners and experts alike.
:::

Choose between Foundry, Remix, or any development environment of your choice.

For Foundy or Local Users:

:::tip Pre-requisites
Make sure you have git installed to clone the repository. If not, you can download it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
:::

Begin by cloning the GitHub repository to your local machine.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/SocketDotTech/socketDL-examples
cd src/impl/Counter.sol
```

For Remix users, use the link below to load the Counter contract directly: [Load Counter in Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://github.com/SocketDotTech/socketDL-examples/blob/templates/src/impl/Counter.sol)

### Code Walkthrough

Begin by examining the Counter Contract, it inherits essential functions from the [`PlugBase` contract](https://github.com/SocketDotTech/socketDL-examples/blob/main/src/base/PlugBase.sol) for seamless integration with SocketDL.

#### Key Functions

#### 1. `setRemoteNumber`

:::tip Function Insights
This function initiates the Socket's `outbound` method to send a cross-chain message, updating the counter value on the target chain.
:::

The `setRemoteNumber` function accepts two parameters:

- `newNumber_`: The new value to update the counter with
- `toChainSlug_`: The Chain ID of the destination blockchain

```javascript
function setRemoteNumber(
    uint256 newNumber_,
    uint256 toChainSlug_
) external payable {
    _outbound(toChainSlug_, destGasLimit, msg.value, abi.encode(newNumber_));
}
```

Here, `_outbound` is a method from the Socket, invoked to initiate the cross-chain message. The `newNumber_` is encoded into the message payload, and `toChainSlug_` identifies the destination chain.

##### 2. `_receiveInbound`

:::info Payload Decoding
This function decodes the received payload and updates the counter value on the local chain. It's an integral part of the message receiving lifecycle.
:::

The `_receiveInbound` function is internally called when a message is relayed to the destination chain. It's triggered by the `inbound` function of the `PlugBase` contract.

Inherited from the `PlugBase` Contract:

```javascript
function inbound(
  uint256 siblingChainSlug_,
  bytes calldata payload_
) external payable {
  require(msg.sender == address(socket), "no auth");
  _receiveInbound(siblingChainSlug_, payload_);
}
```

The `inbound` function checks the authenticity of the message (ensuring it originates from the Socket) and then calls `_receiveInbound`.

In the `Counter` Contract:

```javascript
function _receiveInbound(
    uint256,
    bytes memory payload_
) internal virtual override {
    uint256 newNumber = abi.decode(payload_, (uint256));
    setNumber(newNumber);
}
```

Here, the `payload_` containing the new counter value is decoded, and `setNumber` updates the counter on the local chain. The local counter mirrors the update made on the originating chain, completing the cross-chain interaction.

### Deployment

Deploying the Counter contract involves a few steps to ensure it's properly configured and ready to interact with the blockchain. This section will guide you through the deployment process, both using Foundry and Remix.

#### Constructor Arguments

The `Counter` contract requires the address of the Socket contract when deploying. Retrieve the appropriate Socket address for your desired network from the [`deployments`](../Deployments.mdx) documentation.

For this tutorial, we deploying the Counter contract on the Polygon and Optimism networks. Here are the respective Socket addresses for these networks:

| Chain | Socket Address                               |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 137   | `0x4c8D9ab0F4f6A959092248982bd58D2C964957d6` |
| 10    | `0x2959eBC446A4dFB30b04AfD62B0cBD3F914306B4` |

:::info Command Line Placeholders Replacement
Replace the placeholders in the commands with the actual values to ensure proper contract interaction.
:::

#### Foundry Deployment

1. Install Foundry using the command:
   ```shell
   forge install
   ```
2. Compile and deploy two Counter contracts, one on each chain, replacing the placeholders with the appropriate values:
   ```shell
   forge create --rpc-url <SENDING_RPC> \
   --constructor-args <SOCKET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> \
   --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> \
   src/impl/Counter.sol:Counter
   ```

#### Remix Deployment

Remix is a web-based IDE that allows for smart contract deployment directly from the browser. Follow these steps to deploy the Counter contract using Remix.

1. Ensure that your injected wallet (such as MetaMask) is connected to the network you intend to deploy to.
2. In Remix, input the Socket address into the Counter contract’s constructor parameter field.
3. Click ‘Deploy’ to deploy the Counter contract onto the network.
4. Repeat the process for the other chain you wish to deploy to.

:::success Deployment Success
Congratulations! You've now deployed the Counter contract to the blockchain. It's ready to send and receive cross-chain messages!
:::

### Configuring Plugs

After deploying your Counter contracts, the next essential step is to connect them, enabling cross-chain interactions. The `connect` function is crucial in establishing this connection, ensuring the Counter plugs on different chains can communicate seamlessly.

#### Parameters for the `connect` Function

The parameters vary depending on the chain. Here’s a breakdown for both Polygon and Optimism.

#### For Polygon

| Parameter           | Value                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| siblingChainSlug    | 10                                         |
| siblingPlug         | Address of Counter on Optimism             |
| inboundSwitchboard  | 0x2521b29FD8d3787Ab42141f55F6b462E6115C737 |
| outboundSwitchboard | 0x2521b29FD8d3787Ab42141f55F6b462E6115C737 |

#### For Optimism

| Parameter           | Value                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| siblingChainSlug    | 137                                        |
| siblingPlug         | Address of Counter on Polygon              |
| inboundSwitchboard  | 0x8654cB74011C9972dd63Ed691d310e1BAA85Fe9E |
| outboundSwitchboard | 0x8654cB74011C9972dd63Ed691d310e1BAA85Fe9E |

:::tip Switchboard Addresses
Refer to the [official documentation](https://developer.socket.tech/dev-resources/deployment-addresses) for switchboard addresses on other chains.
:::

### Executing the Connection Command

#### Foundry `connect`

Execute the following command for both contracts, replacing the placeholders with the appropriate values:

```shell
cast send <ADDRESS_OF_COUNTER> --rpc-url <RPC> \
--private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> \
"connect(uint32,address,address,address)" \
<SIBLING_CHAIN_SLUG> <ADDRESS_OF_DESTINATION_ON_SENDING_CHAIN> <INBOUND_SWITCHBOARD> <OUTBOUND_SWITCHBOARD>
```

#### Remix `connect`

1. Navigate to the deployed Counter contract.
2. Call the `connect` function, inputting the details of its counterpart on the other chain.

:::info Connectivity
The `connect` function is crucial. It bridges your contract to a counterpart on another chain, opening pathways for cross-chain messages.
:::

### Validation

Upon executing the connection commands, validate the connection by calling the `getPlugConfig` method on Socket. It returns the configuration of the plug, confirming a successful connection. Now your contracts are ready to exchange messages across chains!

#### Foundry Validation

Execute the following command for both contracts, replacing the placeholders with the appropriate values:

```shell
cast call <SOCKET_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> --rpc-url <RPC_URL> \
"getPlugConfig(address,uint32)" \
<PLUG_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> <SIBLING_CHAIN_SLUG>
```

The command will return the configuration details of the plug, including the addresses of the sibling plug, inbound and outbound switchboards, capacitor, and decapacitor. Ensure these values match your configuration.

#### Remix Validation

1. Navigate to the deployed Socket contract within the Remix interface.
2. Call `getPlugConfig`:
   - Enter the Counter plug contract address in the `plugAddress_` field.
   - Input the chain ID into the `siblingChainSlug_` field.
   - Click on the `Call` button.
3. The values for the sibling plug, inbound and outbound switchboards, capacitor, and decapacitor will be displayed in the Remix interface. Validate these values to ensure correct cross-chain communication setup.

### Updating the Counter Value Across Chains

:::info Preparing the Command
Prepare to input the appropriate parameters. The `setRemoteNumber` function requires the new counter value and the target chain's slug.
:::

#### Foundry `setRemoteNumber`

Execute the following command, replacing the placeholders with the appropriate values:

```shell
cast send <ADDRESS_OF_COUNTER_ON_SENDING_CHAIN> --rpc-url <SENDING_RPC> \
--private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> \
"setRemoteNumber(uint256,uint32)" \
55 137
```

#### Remix `setRemoteNumber`

1. Navigate to the Counter contract deployed on Optimism within Remix.
2. Locate the setRemoteNumber function.
3. Enter the values 55 for the new number and 137 as the chain slug.
4. Execute the function.

### Monitoring the Message Transit

:::tip Real-Time Tracking
Leverage the Status Tracking API to monitor the message in real time as it travels between the chains.
:::

Utilize the [Status Tracking API](../dev-resources/APIReference/Track.md) and follow the URL pattern below, ensuring to replace `<YourTxHash>` with the actual transaction hash:

```plaintext
https://prod.dlapi.socket.tech/messages-from-tx?srcChainSlug=10&srcTxHash=<YourTxHash>
```

### Verifying the Update

:::success Confirmation Steps
Verify the operation’s success by checking the updated Counter value on the Polygon network.
:::

Upon the successful delivery and processing of the message, the Counter value on Polygon should now reflect the new number. This demonstrates a successful cross-chain operation, where a contract on one blockchain network (Optimism) has effectively updated the state of a contract on another network (Polygon).

#### Foundry Verification

Execute the following command, replacing the placeholders with the appropriate values:

```shell
cast call <ADDRESS_OF_COUNTER_ON_RECEIVING_CHAIN> --rpc-url <RECEIVING_RPC> \
"number(uint256)"
```

This command will query the current value of the counter on the Polygon network.

#### Remix Verification

1. Navigate to the deployed `Counter` contract on Polygon within the Remix interface.
2. Locate and click on the `number` function to retrieve the current counter value.

:::info Expected Outcome
The counter value returned should be 55, confirming the success of the cross-chain operation.
:::
