Message execution may fail on the destination chain for the following reasons :
1. `msgGasLimit` sent on source chain is insufficient to cover the gas cost of sending the message on the destination chain
2. `Fees` sent on source chain do not cover the fees of sending the message on the destination chain
3. The `inbound` method call on the Plug is failing on destination chain. This may happen if the contract has logic in the inbound function which is failing. 
4. The packet which includes the message is not verified yet 

Executors will simulate the transaction and keep re-trying executing the message payload on the destination chain. It will keep trying for 2-3 hours and if the message doesn't execute, the message has to be sent again from source chain.

In the first and second case as well, there is no action that Plugs can take to execute the message. The message has to be sent again from the source chain.
