App Chain Bridge, also known as SuperBridge, is a bespoke token bridge engineered for App Chains or custom roll-ups. Users can configure this bridge as either a Lock-Mint bridge for existing tokens or a Burn-Mint bridge for tokens that support Universal ERC20s.

One of the notable implementations of the App Chain Bridge is its role in enabling USDC bridging on [Aevo's Optimistic App-Chain](https://mirror.xyz/0x6FD2bd90D50eDEe139103454116F252f6F5eC928/s602ukNdxwBkr9imWWO2MBgzpNny0O1ews_Nev75ppM).

## Aevo Bridge: A Case Study

Aevo introduced a native bridging system powered by Socket to facilitate zero-cost transfers from Arbitrum & Optimism. This innovation marked a significant milestone, making Aevo the first OP-Stack rollup to enable users beyond Ethereum to bridge USDC from Arbitrum & Optimism seamlessly.

### Key Highlights

- **Zero-Cost Transfers:** Users can transfer assets across chains without incurring bridging fees.
- **Accessibility:** App rollups, previously restricted to Ethereum, can now access liquidity across various chains.
- **Simplicity:** Users can deposit and trade on Aevo from major L2s without dealing with wrapped bridge assets.

### How It Works

1. Visit [app.aevo.xyz](https://app.aevo.xyz).
2. Choose the chain from which you want to deposit.
3. Your funds are deposited into the Aevo Exchange within minutes.
4. Start trading immediately.

### Expanding Connectivity

The integration of Socket not only eliminates high bridging fees and the complexities of liquidity bootstrapping but also enables app rollups to extend their reach, accessing a plethora of liquidity pools available across diverse chains. This unprecedented level of connectivity empowers app rollups to offer users seamless, cost-effective cross-chain interactions.

:::note
With Socketâ€™s integration, app rollups can launch with native connectivity to any chain, echoing the interoperability benefits akin to IBC for Cosmos-based chains.
