In this speed run tutorial, we'll be writing a contract to send/receive messages between chains. This is a code along tutorial, you can copy the code snippets into Remix or the dev environment of your choice. In case you are stuck, you can take peak at the [entire code on GitHub](https://github.com/SocketDotTech/socketDL-examples/blob/main/src/SpeedRunDL/SocketSpeedRunGoerli.sol). We'll be highlighting key functions and what they do throughout the tutorial. Some configuration variables have been hardcoded in the example.

We'll be deploying the same copy of the contract on Goerli and Mumbai testnet and sending the message "Hello World" from Goerli to Mumbai. You can also deploy it on any [supported networks](./DeploymentsSection/Deployments.mdx). Let's get started!


### Step 1 : Boilerplate code 

Below is the boilerplate code needed to get started. `ISocket` is the interface used by our contract to interact with Socket. 

`Hello World` is the contract which we'll be writing to send/receive messages.

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface ISocket {
    function outbound(
        uint256 remoteChainSlug_,
        uint256 msgGasLimit_,
        bytes calldata payload_
    ) external payable returns (bytes32 msgId);

    function connect(
        uint256 siblingChainSlug_,
        address siblingPlug_,
        address inboundSwitchboard_,
        address outboundSwitchboard_
    ) external;

    function getMinFees(
        uint256 msgGasLimit_,
        uint32 remoteChainSlug_,
        address plug_
    ) external view returns (uint256 totalFees);
}

contract HelloWorld {

}
```

### Step 2 : Initialise state variables, events, modifiers

#### State variables
`message` is the message which will be set on the remote plug. `destGasLimit` is the gas limit of setting the message on the destination chain, this value mary vary depending on the chain.

You can learn more about the other variables in [Configuring Plugs](./Getting-Started/configuring-plugs.md)

#### Events
`MessageSent` is emitted when a message is sent from the source plug and `MessageReceived` is emitted when the message is received on the destination plug.

```javascript
    string public message;
    address owner;

    uint256 destGasLimit = 100000; // Gas cost of sending "Hello World" on Mumbai
    uint32 public remoteChainSlug = 80001; // Mumbai testnet chain ID
    address public socket = 0xA78426325b5e32Affd5f4Bc8ab6575B24DCB1762; // Socket Address on Goerli
    address public inboundSwitchboard = 0x483D7e9dDBbbE0d376986168Ac4d94E35c485C69; // FAST Switchboard on Goerli
    address public outboundSwitchboard = 0x483D7e9dDBbbE0d376986168Ac4d94E35c485C69; // FAST Switchboard on Goerli

    event MessageSent(uint256 destChainSlug, string message);
    
    event MessageReceived(uint256 srcChainSlug, string message);

    modifier isOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not owner");
        _;
    }

    modifier isSocket() {
        require(msg.sender == socket, "Not Socket");
        _;
    }

    error InsufficientFees();

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
```

### Step 3 : Config Functions

`connectPlug` function connects our Hello World [Plug](../Learn/glossary.md) to its sibling Plug on another chain

```javascript 

    function connectPlug ( 
        address siblingPlug_
    ) external isOwner {
        ISocket(socket).connect(
         remoteChainSlug,
         siblingPlug_,
         inboundSwitchboard,
         outboundSwitchboard
        );
    }

```

### Step 4 : Sending messages 

`sendMessage` sends the "Hello World" message to the remote chain. This function calls Socket and initiates the `outbound` cross-chain message

`_getMinimumFees` fetches the fees for including messages in [Packets](../Learn/Components/Packet.md) & executing them. You can learn more about this in [Fees](../Learn/Concepts/Fees.md).

```javascript
    function sendMessage() external payable {
        uint256 totalFees = _getMinimumFees(destGasLimit, remoteChainSlug);

        if(msg.value < totalFees) revert InsufficientFees();
        
        bytes memory payload = abi.encode("Hello World");

        ISocket(socket).outbound(
            remoteChainSlug, 
            destGasLimit,
            payload
        );

        emit MessageSent(remoteChainSlug, message);
    }

    function _getMinimumFees(uint256 msgGasLimit_, uint32 _remoteChainSlug) internal view returns (uint256) {
        return ISocket(socket).getMinFees(msgGasLimit_, _remoteChainSlug, address(this));
    }
```

### Step 5 : Receiving Messages 

`inbound` is called by Socket on the destination chain for relaying the message once it's verified. More in this in [Lifecycle](../Learn/lifecycle.md)

`_receiveMessage` sets the value of the new message and emits the `MessageReceived` event

```javascript
    function _receiveMessage(uint256 _srcChainSlug, string memory _message) internal {
        message = _message;
        emit MessageReceived(_srcChainSlug, _message);
    }

    function inbound(uint256 srcChainSlug_, bytes calldata payload_) external isSocket {
        (string memory _message) = abi.decode(payload_, (string));
        _receiveMessage(srcChainSlug_, _message);
    }
```

### Step 6 : Deploying contracts

We'll be deploying the same contract on Goerli and Mumbai testnets. However, to make it easier to send our first message, we've hardcoded some configuration variables specific to Goerli and Mumbai. Click the links below to deploy each of them

#### Goerli
[ðŸš€ Deploy Goerli contract on Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://github.com/SocketDotTech/socketDL-examples/blob/main/src/SpeedRunDL/SocketSpeedRunGoerli.sol)

[ðŸ“„ Goerli contract on GitHub](https://github.com/SocketDotTech/socketDL-examples/blob/main/src/SpeedRunDL/SocketSpeedRunGoerli.sol)

#### Mumbai
[ðŸš€ Deploy Mumbai contract on Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://github.com/SocketDotTech/socketDL-examples/blob/main/src/SpeedRunDL/SocketSpeedRunMumbai.sol)

[ðŸ“„ Mumbai contract on GitHub](https://github.com/SocketDotTech/socketDL-examples/blob/main/src/SpeedRunDL/SocketSpeedRunMumbai.sol)

You can head over to Remix and compile the code for `SpeedRunGoerli`

 <img src="/img/compiler-hello-world.png" width="500px"/>

Then, deploy it

<img src="/img/deploy-hello-world.png" width="500px"/>

<br/><br/>

You'll then have to deploy the `SpeedRunMumbai` contract following the same steps.


### Step 7 : Configuration 

Once you've deployed the contracts on Goerli and Mumbai, call the `connectPlug` function with the address of the contract deployed on the other chain. You need to do this on both contracts deployed on respective chains.

<img src="/img/connectPlug-hello-world.png" width="500px"/>

<br/><br/>

For instance, on Goerli you would call `connectPlug` with the address of the contract deployed on Mumbai and vice-versa. This establishes a connection between the two Plugs deployed and you can now send messages between them!

### Step 8 : Hello World

To send your first message, call the `sendMessage` function on Goerli. You need to send a fee in ETH as `value` when calling `sendMessage`. This fee can be calculated using the [Fee Estimate API](./APIReference/EstimateFee.md) 

https://surge.dlapi.socket.tech/estimate-fees?srcChainSlug=5&dstChainSlug=80001&integrationType=FAST&msgGasLimit=100000

You can enter the `totalFee` returned by this API as `value` when sending the transaction

<img src="/img/sendMessage-hello-world.png" width="400px"/>

<br/><br/>

That's it! You can now track the status of your message using the [Status Tracking API](./APIReference/Track.md). Once your transaction is successful, you'll be able to see the `message` value set to "Hello World" on Goerli.
