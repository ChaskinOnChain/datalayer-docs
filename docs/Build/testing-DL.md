Plugs can test their integration with Socket using MockSocket, which is a contract that simulates the functionality of Socket without actually passing a message on-chain.

- What is MockSocket? 
- How does it work? 
- How can plugs use it? 
- Why should plugs use it? 
- What's the indication that everything is all ok? 
- Where can they see an example? 
- What's next? 
    - Once MockSocket test is done, try deploying on a testnet
