Security in message passing means when you send a message from source to destination, you want to ensure the integrity of the message is intact on the destination chain.


SocketDL contracts are immutable, without proxies. 

Once a switchboard is added, it cannot be removed by Admin. 



Contract Security 

// WIP

explanation of modular security model
how Switchboards work, what trust assumptions you do and donâ€™t have, what the risks 
(If switchboards are not built securely it could lead to loss of funds or a fradulent message being accepted, overall smart contract risk, etc) 

### Contract Security 

SocketDL contracts are immutable, trust-less and without proxies.

### Architecture Security

Socket's architecture is modular 

### Switchboard Security 

Switchboards are the epicenter of security on Socket.

The 3 switchboards live on Socket currently have robust security guarantees : 
1. Native Switchboard : Use Native bridges for routing message from source to destination chain. This is the most secure 

2. Fast Switchboard : 

3. Optimistic Switchboard :
