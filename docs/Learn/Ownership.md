We strongly believe that contracts should be immutable, non-upgradable, upgrades should be opt-in by clients. We have clear roles on the contract and clear plans on how to remove them. All roles are clearly listed in the AccessRoles.sol contract.

Here are some of the roles and the purpose:
- RESCUE_ROLE: It's only used to rescue funds if stuck in a contract which isnt supposed to hold contract. This is just a safety role to allow us to give back people their ERC20s and ETHER that they might have accidently sent.
- WITHDRAW_ROLE: We haven't build a permissionless way to execute fee distribution via TransmitManager, ExecutionManager and Switchboard yet, hence we have this special role to allow us to withdraw and distribute the fees. This role is supposed to be deprecated once the fee distribution logic is on-chain. This does not impact the security implications for the end user and only affects the off-chain agents.
- EXECUTOR_ROLE: This role whitelists addresses to allow them to execute messages post permissionless validation by the switchboard. This role is currently permissioned to prevent users from harmful effects of REV. This role holds no security implications.
- TRANSMITTER_ROLE: This role is not part of Socket protocol. This role is used by TransmitManager to grant approval to a particular transmitter to seal and propose packets. TransmitterManager is a modular contract. 
- GOVERNANCE_ROLE: This one is an interesting one. The role is minimiall used and thats by intention. This role CANNOT UPDATE the security properties of a message and or modify user preferences. This role is minimally used in the core-contracts to update the transmitter-manager and execution-manager modules, both of those modules cannot harm the end developer and in the worst case just pause the protocol as the current transmit-manager and execution-manager modules are implemented. Apart from the core-contracts, the GOVERNANCE_ROLE can be utilised with a different setting in the swithboards but switchboards are permissionless already and developers can remove or update the usage of the role according to their preferences.
