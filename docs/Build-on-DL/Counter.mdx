In this tutorial, we'll explore how to build and deploy a cross-chain counter. Users can change the value of the counter on the destination chain from the source chain.

The Counter example is pre-deployed on a few chains. You can try it out via block explorers on the following chains :

### Code Walkthrough

You can find the code for this tutorial in the [`SocketDL-examples` GitHub](https://github.com/SocketDotTech/socketDL-examples). 


This example inherits the PlugBase contract, which is a boilerplate contract that has the key functions/specs needed to interact with Socket. Learn more about this in the Getting Started section.

The cross-chain counter has 2 key functions 
1. `setNumber` 
setNumber accepts toChainSlug_, which is the destination chain ID and newNumber_ which will be set as the new count on the destination chain. 

setNumber calls the outbound function on Socket which initiates the message passing

```javascript
    function setNumber(
        uint256 newNumber_,
        uint256 toChainSlug_
    ) external payable {
        _outbound(toChainSlug_, destGasLimit, msg.value, abi.encode(newNumber_));
    }

```

2. `_receiveInbound`

- Called by the inbound function which is in PlugBase 

### Deploying contracts 



### Configuring Plugs 

-  Connect Plug to Socket with sibling plug config 
- Do the same with sibling plug 
- Highlight switchboards. Link to switchboard life cycle 

### Sending message 

### Tracking status of message 

### Destination chain 

- Link example transaction
