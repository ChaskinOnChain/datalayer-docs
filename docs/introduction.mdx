Socket Data Layer (SocketDL) is an arbitrary message passing protocol designed to facilitate seamless cross-chain interactions. Together with [SocketLL](https://docs.socket.tech/socket-overview/what-is-socket), it forms the Socket Interopability Stack, empowering developers to create secure, efficient, and innovative cross-chain applications.

### Components of Socket’s Interoperability Stack

- **SocketLL**: Enables efficient asset transfer across chains. It unifies liquidity across bridges and DEXs, and routes funds via them based on user preferences like fees, speed or security.
- **SocketDL**: Enables secure data transfer across chains. It unifies chains by connecting all smart contracts on all chains, allowing them to perform read and write operations on each other.

:::info Unlock New Possibilities
By combining **SocketLL** for efficient asset transfers and **SocketDL** for secure data interactions, developers can build complete cross-chain dApps. This synergy unlocks a new wave of innovative applications, bridging ecosystems and creating a connected, interoperable blockchain landscape.

### Features of SocketDL

1. **Arbitrary Message Passing**

   - Enables contracts on distinct blockchains to communicate and modify each other's states, leveraging `bytes` encoded messages.
   - Instrumental in optimizing asset and data transfers, positioning SocketDL as a cornerstone for developers and users alike.

2. **Modular Architecture**

   - Allows dApps the flexibility to integrate selective components of the Socket stack, fostering customization and efficiency.
   - Enhances the capability for developers to build their own off-chain agents tailored for specific message delivery and execution needs.

3. **Security with Configurability**

   - Allows [Plugs](./Learn/Components/Plugs.md) (smart contracts that connect to the Socket for cross-chain message passing) to customize [Switchboards](./Learn/Components/Switchboards.md) (open-source permissionless configuration bundles), adjusting security protocols per operational necessities.
   - Strikes a balance between robust security and communication speed, adapted to diverse operational scenarios.

4. **Simplified Integration**
   - Streamlines the integration of cross-chain functionalities, requiring only the inheritance of [PlugBase](https://github.com/SocketDotTech/socketDL-examples/blob/main/src/base/PlugBase.sol) and a user-friendly [interface](./dev-resources/Interfaces/IPlug.md).
